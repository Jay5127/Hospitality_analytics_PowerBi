## Problem Statement

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue.




### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4 : Visual filters (Slicers) were added for four fields named "City", "Room Type", "Year" & "Week No".
- Step 5 : Multiple card visuals were added to the canvas, each representing different fields.
           Using visual level filter from the filters pane, basic filtering was used & null values were unselected for consideration into average calculation.
- Step 6:  Thus we successfully created our dashboard.
           
           Although, by default, while calculating average, blank values are ignored
